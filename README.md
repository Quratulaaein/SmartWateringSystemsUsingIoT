# SmartWateringSystemsUsingIoT
This project is done under #Mathworks #SustainabilityandRenewable Energy Challenge

# Overview
The topic of this project is Smart Watering Systems Using IoT, concentrating on a Center Pivot Irrigation System (CPIS) in particular. With the use of real-time data, the technology seeks to automate irrigation procedures and effectively manage water resources.

# Features
- Center Pivot Irrigation Simulation: This tool allows to mimic the motion and functionality of a standard center pivot irrigation system.
- IoT Integration: Gather information on soil moisture, meteorological conditions, and other pertinent factors by using IoT devices.
- Automated Watering: Use sophisticated algorithms to set up watering schedules based on historical data and preset thresholds.
- Data Logging and Analytics: Record and examine information about irrigation schedules, meteorological conditions, and soil moisture content.

# Requirements
- MATLAB/Simulink for simulation and modeling.
- IoT devices (sensors, actuators, controllers) for data collection.
